         For practice:

         Open your index.html file
         Create and checkout a new branch called experiment
         Add another paragraph to your web page after your list. Lorem ipsum is fine.
         Commit your change (hint: use git commit -am "msg" to add and commit at once!)
         checkout the master branch
         Add yet another paragraph to your web page before your list Perhaps a title or subtitle.
         Commit your change
         Switch between the experiment and master branches (clicking on your editor in-between). Do you see the file contents changing?
